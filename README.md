📱 **Mobile Sales Data Analysis**

📘 **Project Overview**

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of a Mobile Sales Dataset to uncover actionable insights about sales performance, pricing trends, and customer preferences. The main goal is to identify factors that contribute to higher mobile sales and understand overall sales behavior across various brands and models.

🎯 Objectives

Conduct detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on mobile sales data.

Identify top-performing mobile brands and models.

Analyze the relationship between features, price, and sales.

Visualize patterns and trends to support informed business decisions.

📂 Dataset Information

The dataset includes mobile sales data with the following columns:

Mobile ID – Unique identifier for each phone.

Brand Name – Brand of the mobile (e.g., Samsung, Apple, Vivo).

Model Name – Specific model of the mobile phone.

Price – Selling price of the mobile device.

Quantity Sold – Total units sold.

Rating – Customer rating or feedback score.

RAM / Storage – Device specifications.

Date – Sale date or period.

Region – Location of the sale.

(Column names can be adjusted based on the dataset used.)

⚙️ Tools & Technologies

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Excel: Initial data verification

Jupyter Notebook: Data exploration and visualization

📊 Project Workflow
1. Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates and handled missing or incorrect entries.

Standardized column names and data formats.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed sales trends by brand, price range, and customer ratings.

Studied correlations between features such as RAM, storage, and price.

3. Visualization

Created bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to highlight insights.

Compared sales across different time periods and brands.

📈 Key Insights

Mid-range phones (moderate pricing) sell more than premium ones.

Certain brands consistently lead in sales volume and customer satisfaction.

High-rated phones have better repeat purchase trends.

Storage and RAM capacity significantly influence purchasing decisions.
