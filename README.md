Sales-Project 📱 Mobile Sales Data Analysis 📘 Project Overview This project focuses on analyzing the Mobile Sales Dataset to gain insights into sales performance, pricing trends, and customer preferences. The main objective is to identify which factors contribute to higher mobile sales and understand the overall sales behavior across different brands and models. 🎯 Project Objectives Perform detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on mobile sales data. Identify top-performing mobile brands and models. Analyze the relationship between features, price, and sales. Visualize patterns and trends to support better business decisions. 📂 Dataset Information The dataset contains mobile sales information such as: Mobile ID – Unique identifier for each phone. Brand Name – The brand of the mobile (e.g., Samsung, Apple, Vivo, etc.). Model Name – Specific model of the mobile phone. Price – Selling price of the mobile device. Quantity Sold – Total number of units sold. Rating – Customer rating or feedback score. RAM / Storage – Device specifications. Date – The day or period of sale. Region – The location or area where the sale occurred. (You can adjust the column names as per your dataset.) ⚙️ Tools & Technologies Used Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) Excel for initial data verification Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and visualization 📊 Project Workflow Data Cleaning Removed duplicates and handled missing or incorrect entries. Standardized column names and data formats. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Analyzed sales trends by brand, price range, and customer ratings. Studied correlations between features (RAM, storage, price, etc.). Visualization Created bar charts, line graphs, and pie charts to highlight insights. Compared sales across different time periods and brands. Insights & Findings Identified top-selling brands and models. Discovered pricing segments with the highest sales. 📈 Key Insights Mid-range phones (with moderate pricing) tend to sell more than premium ones. Certain brands consistently lead in sales volume and customer satisfaction. High-rated phones have better repeat purchase trends. Storage and RAM capacity significantly influence purchasing decisions. 🚀 How to Run the Project Clone the GitHub repository. Open the project in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
